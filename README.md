# Balthazar

Open-hardware laptop computer modules description and concept.

These are designs of  modules as presented at https://balthazar.space/wiki/Balthazar with the main aim for team access. See the [main repository](https://github.com/balthazar-space/balthazar) for other designs.

# Balthazar case and design 

Balthazar's casing or a housing and its design.

This is the place for pictures of casing design and 3D ready-to-print files and other design proposals.

A new reorganisation of the files starting from the 1st ever version v0.1, going over to the current v0.2.

Each future version will have its iteration version, containing pictures of made elements and assembled casings, Blender models, 
3D print-ready files, documentation usually encapsulated in README.md file, and adjoining extra files to ease and explain assembly process. 
We will try to accomodate all of the aspects. 

In the case of modifying the case, we encourage you to precisely indicate and include short descriptions of casing openings 
to a certain SoM (systems on a Module) and outputs.

Those files will be updated as we move on and as revisions change to a final look and also materials will vary.
We will ensure that home and industrial versions are made, so that everyone can make case, wheather as a school project, 
cheaper home D-I-Y or ready for a mass production.

About the file formats - the truth is following.
The issues we are encountering and it is as it might be
somewhat problematic with Open Source software. 
CAD is complicated on Linux, as it is a big
business - and we must fight for it to have it more open.

However to be more professional in those both directions, we will try to be reluctantly compliant, 
balancing between the industry and our community.  

You can watch .dxf files only with Autocad software and also on your mobile 
device with a few dedicated apps. 
DWG files you can see also with Adobe programs, but because they are
basically all just drawings they will be shown as 2d drawings then. 
Only in Autocad you can see them as 3D objects.
So you see the dxf files, but if you have no Autocad, you can not do anything with them.
Bummer that is and out of our reach, right now.

All resources licensed under the CERN Open Hardware Licence CERN-OHL W V.2.0

Version 2.0 of the CERN-OHL introduces three variants of the licence – strongly (S) reciprocal, weakly (W) reciprocal and permissive (P) – which aim to address specific constraints caused by different collaboration models currently used in open-hardware projects. 

The first two variants mean that if any product is made using an open hardware design, the design of that product, including any improvements or modifications, should be made available under the same licence as that of the original product. Permissive licences do not impose this condition.
